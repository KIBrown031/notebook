Common Aliases
git status, git add, git commit, and git checkout are such common commands that it is useful to have abbreviations for them.

Add the following to the .gitconfig file in your $HOME directory.

.gitconfig
[alias]
  co = checkout
  ci = commit
  st = status
  br = branch
  hist = log --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short
  type = cat-file -t
  dump = cat-file -p
