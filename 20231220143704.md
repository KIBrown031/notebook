Select-Object -ExpandProperty

-ExpandProperty on a Property containing an Array or single value will ignore other properties like your example.

-ExpandProperty on a Property containing a PSObject will add a row for record with the -Property list and include the expanded properties that matched to that row.

Using your example, I embed PSObject called three containing values 3 and 4 and it gets added :

[pscustomobject] @{ one = 1; two = 2; three = [pscustomobject] @{ three = 3; four = 4 } }| 
    Select one, two -ExpandProperty three 

three four one two
----- ---- --- ---
    3    4   1   2

This is very useful for flattening data from nested objects so that you have it all in the main record. 
For example, I took custom fields that were embedded in a ticket and expanded it this way so that the custom field would look like a regular field alongside the others.
