SYSRESCUE-CUSTOMIZE: CUSTOMIZE SYSTEMRESCUE ISO-IMAGES

There are several cases where modifying SystemRescue makes sense, for example when you want to configure YAML files or add SystemRescueModules (SRM).

The recommended method for this is usually to create USB-media using Rufus or SystemRescue USB writer as described here, because it creates a USB memory stick partitioned like a disk drive and that allows you to directly modify it with the regular methods provided by your operating system.

But sometimes it is better to modify the ISO-image instead, for example when the Rufus-method is inconvenient or you need an ISO-image to boot a virtual machine. Since ISO-images were developed for read-only media, they are inherently read-only. To modify them you have to unpack, modify and then rebuild them. This is what this script does.

Preparation
Download the most recent version of sysrescue-customize from here:

Linux
The best way to use sysrescue-customize is usually on another Linux system. It is a bash script written in a way that it is compatible with most common Linux systems. It checks for all necessary programs at the start. These are usually part of the base installation, except xorriso and mksquashfs. These can usually be installed with the package manager of your distribution.

SystemRescue
The script is also included on SystemRescue itself. But running it there has the downside that you need about 3 times the size of SystemRescue as Copy-on-Write space for a full rebuild. So you may need to change the cow_spacesize=xx boot option or use a permanent backing store to make it work.

Windows
You can run sysrescue-customize with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). When using the default Ubuntu variant, you have to install the dependencies like this:

sudo apt install xorriso squashfs-tools
Manual mode
In manual mode you first unpack the provided ISO-image of SystemRescue like this:

sysrescue-customize --unpack --source=<ISO-FILE> --dest=<DIR>
You can then modify the contents of the image in the given destination directory. Afterwards you can rebuild the image again:

sysrescue-customize --rebuild --source=<DIR> --dest=<ISO-FILE>
When the destination directory or ISO-file already exists, the script will abort. If you want to let it overwrite instead, use the --overwrite option.
