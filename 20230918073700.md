How to Remove or ignore all comment lines from Linux config files

The commands below will show you how to view the uncommented lines of a file and ignore the commented lines. You will also see how to permanently remove the commented lines from a file, as well as remove all empty lines. The idea is to make it easier to sift through a configuration file for the relevant settings by suppressing all of the commented lines.

Suppose that you would like to read a config file without comments. The following grep command assumes that each comment starts with a single # character at the beginning of the line. To remove or ignore all comments from a file, the following grep command can be used:

$ grep -v ^\# config.conf | grep  .

Note that we also pipe to grep . in this example in order to suppress the output of all empty lines. This way we only see the settings in our terminal.


A second way to remove all commented lines:

$ grep -o '^[^#]*' file config.conf


What if you want to remove all commented lines plus write the changes to a file? In that case you can redirect output with > operator to a new file.

$ grep -o '^[^#]*' file config.conf > updated_config.conf


Or write the changes directly back to the original file with sponge.

$ grep -o '^[^#]*' file config.conf | sponge config.conf


Yet another possibility is to use the sed command. Add the -i option if you want to make permanent changes to the file, rather than just seeing the output without commented lines.

$ sed '/^[[:blank:]]*#/d;s/#.*//' config.conf
