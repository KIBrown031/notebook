$matches

#Let's make a little list of words
$words = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".Split()
 
#Now show only words that start with a letter between "a" and "l" and also have an "o" somewhere in the word.
$Words | Where {$_ -match "[A-L,a-l].*o.*"} | Foreach {$Matches[0]}

That really can’t be done with using a -like comparison operator and normal wildcards. 
Still not sure if you’d have a use case for having the matches of a regular expression displayed? 
Here’s when you want to use it.

Grab a list of strings. Pipe them into a Where-Object or Select-String to perform a -match against them. 
If what you want is the whole string when it has the match, then you just use the standard output. 

But if what you want is only the resulting match, then you can pipe it to Foreach-Object {$matches[0]}
