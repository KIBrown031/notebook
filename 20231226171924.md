$matches

#Let's make a little list of words
$words = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".Split()
 
#Now show only words that start with a letter between "a" and "l" and also have an "o" somewhere in the word.
$Words | Where {$_ -match "[A-L,a-l].*o.*"} | Foreach {$Matches[0]}

That really can’t be done with using a -like comparison operator and normal wildcards. 
Still not sure if you’d have a use case for having the matches of a regular expression displayed? 
Here’s when you want to use it.

Grab a list of strings. Pipe them into a Where-Object or Select-String to perform a -match against them. 
If what you want is the whole string when it has the match, then you just use the standard output. 

But if what you want is only the resulting match, then you can pipe it to Foreach-Object {$matches[0]}


When a match occurs, PowerShell populates the automatic $Matches variable with information about the matches:

'Hello World' -match '(\w+) (\w+)'
$Matches
# This would return:
 
Name                           Value
----                           -----
2                              World
1                              Hello
0                              Hello World
# So $Matches[0] contains the entire match string, $Matches[1] contains the first capture group, $Matches[2] contains the second capture group, etc.



# Parentheses in a regex pattern define “capture groups” that store matches. 
# After a successful -match operation, PowerShell stores the result in the $matches variable, making it easier to retrieve matched groups.

'Hello World' -match '(\w+) (\w+)'
$Matches[1] # Stores 'Hello'
$Matches[2] # Stores 'World'
# You can retrieve the content of these match groups by index from the $Matches variable.



# Capture groups are very useful for extracting specific parts of a matched string. Here is another example:

"User: John, Age: 25" -match "User: (\w+), Age: (\d+)"
# The $matches PowerShell array now will contain:

$matches[0]: User: John, Age: 25 
$matches[1]: "John"
$matches[2]: "25"
