GIT: Individual Developer (Standalone)
A standalone individual developer does not exchange patches with other people, and works alone in a single repository, using the following commands.

git-init[1] to create a new repository.

git-log[1] to see what happened.

git-switch[1] and git-branch[1] to switch branches.

git-add[1] to manage the index file.

git-diff[1] and git-status[1] to see what you are in the middle of doing.

git-commit[1] to advance the current branch.

git-restore[1] to undo changes.

git-merge[1] to merge between local branches.

git-rebase[1] to maintain topic branches.

git-tag[1] to mark a known point.

Examples
Use a tarball as a starting point for a new repository.
$ tar zxf frotz.tar.gz
$ cd frotz
$ git init
$ git add . (1)
$ git commit -m "import of frotz source tree."
$ git tag v2.43 (2)
add everything under the current directory.

make a lightweight, unannotated tag.

Create a topic branch and develop.
$ git switch -c alsa-audio (1)
$ edit/compile/test
$ git restore curses/ux_audio_oss.c (2)
$ git add curses/ux_audio_alsa.c (3)
$ edit/compile/test
$ git diff HEAD (4)
$ git commit -a -s (5)
$ edit/compile/test
$ git diff HEAD^ (6)
$ git commit -a --amend (7)
$ git switch master (8)
$ git merge alsa-audio (9)
$ git log --since='3 days ago' (10)
$ git log v2.43.. curses/ (11)
create a new topic branch.

revert your botched changes in curses/ux_audio_oss.c.

you need to tell Git if you added a new file; removal and modification will be caught if you do git commit -a later.

to see what changes you are committing.

commit everything, as you have tested, with your sign-off.

look at all your changes including the previous commit.

amend the previous commit, adding all your new changes, using your original message.

switch to the master branch.

merge a topic branch into your master branch.

review commit logs; other forms to limit output can be combined and include -10 (to show up to 10 commits), --until=2005-12-10, etc.

view only the changes that touch whatâ€™s in curses/ directory, since v2.43 tag.
