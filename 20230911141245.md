WSL: exec code error

The issue is that enabling systemd somehow alters /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/
The file (or filelike??) entry WSLInterop.conf goes missing.

I've re-written the answer here rather than just linking as the original reference thread is getting rather long and has dead links.
The oneliner elimiates that problem.

The solution (from here) is to replace that file. Windows executable files start with the two letters MZ
The following tells Linux what to do when trying to run files that start with those letters.

sudo sh -c 'echo :WSLInterop:M::MZ::/init:PF > /usr/lib/binfmt.d/WSLInterop.conf'
sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt
I;m using the 23.04 image from links in this post
I guess this is a bug in packaging, or during installation, but I've no idea who to tell.

@the-moog's solution worked! The only extra step I had to add was unmasking the systemd-binfmt service in order to get it working. So to add to his steps. I unmask the service, restart it, then re-mask it to return it back to its previous protected state besides the new modification.

sudo sh -c 'echo :WSLInterop:M::MZ::/init:PF > /usr/lib/binfmt.d/WSLInterop.conf'
sudo systemctl unmask systemd-binfmt.service
sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt
sudo systemctl mask systemd-binfmt.service
