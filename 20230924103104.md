Clean Uninstall/Install VS-CODE ( Windows PC ) to start afresh.


Step 1 — Soft un-install VSCODE from the PC
Navigate to :

`C:\Users\<your-pc-username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code` to find `unins000.exe` file and execute it this would softly uninstall the vs-code application from the system.

OR

open run prompt on windows by pressing `win + R` and execute %appdata% cmd , this would take you to the `AppData` folder from there you can navigate back a step towards :

`C:\Users\<your-pc-username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code` and find `unins000.exe` file to execute it.



Step 2 — Delete all vs-code cache levels stored in the PC
Find and shift+del code folder found within :

`C:\Users\<your-pc-username>\AppData\Roaming\`

the above step would delete all the cache and log level files wrt to VS-code application so that next time when you install vs-code there would be no user level settings / workspace settings applied from the cache.



Step 3 — Hard Delete all vs-code extensions from the PC
Find and shift+del .vscode folder found within

`C:\Users\<your-pc-username>\`

the above step would make sure all the third party vs-code extensions are deleted off from your PC so that when you install vs-code next time it would be a clean install with no extra extensions being present by default.



Step 4 — Restart the PC once
** No Need of a description for the above step I believe **

Final Step — navigate to vs-code website and install a fresh exe file.
installing vs-code now should result in as a fresh application with all the vs-code default settings and with no extensions at all.
