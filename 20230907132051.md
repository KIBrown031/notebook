My original account was purchased under AT&T and that is ending in September 2023.
I was given a new promotional code to use: jwzoom2023
I was unable to cancel the existing account and apply this promotion.
My login screen offered an upgrade that worked: proannlmjw
This does not allow me to make other users under this promotion to be an alternate host.
I need to get my account to come in under the promotion: jwzoom2023

Can this be done internally by Zoom? If not, what steps must I take to make the switch?
Both promotions are rated at $60/year.

Please advise
